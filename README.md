# Arduino Projects
The two files in this repository "Smoke Detector and Temperasture Detector" were C++ program files that I coded when I was studying Computer Science in Dubai.  This program showcases how to use C++ in order to set instructions in a microcontroller that can then be used in real lif escenarios.  I programmed the temperature detector and smoke detector in tinkercad and then actually implemented the same design in real life using a real micro controller, bread board, and other components.  The purpose of this project was to encourage students to get use to doing their own research to problem solve and apply their coding knowledge to real life use cases that could prove to improve the enviornment around us.
